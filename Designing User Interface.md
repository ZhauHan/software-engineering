# Eight Golden Rules of Interface
## 1) Strive for consistency
1. Ensure consistent sequences of actions in similar scenarios.
2. Use identical terminology across prompts, menus, and help screens.
3. Maintain uniformity in visual elements like color, layout, and fonts, with limited and understandable exceptions for actions like confirming deletions or handling passwords.
## Universal Usability
1. Design interface and facilatating illustration of content.
2. Design for different groups eg. explanation for novices and features for experts. 
3. Visual presentation change according for environment
## Informative Feedback
1) Each action should have feedback. (Delete Success!)
2) Less feedback frequent used items or minor actions and vice versa.
3) Object of interest provides conspicuous visual.
## Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
1. Organize sequences of actions into groups with clear beginnings, middles, and ends.
2. Provide informative feedback at the completion of each group, offering users satisfaction, relief, and guidance for next steps.
3. Example: E-commerce websites guide users from product selection to checkout, concluding with a clear confirmation page for completing transactions.
## Prevent Errors
1. Design the interface to prevent serious errors, such as by graying out inappropriate menu items and restricting alphabetic characters in numeric fields.
2. Provide simple, constructive, and specific instructions for error recovery, allowing users to fix only the faulty part rather than redoing the entire process.
3. Ensure that erroneous actions do not alter the interface state or provide clear instructions for restoring it.
## Easy Reversal of Action
1. Actions should be reversible
2. Assure user that errors can be undone and encourages exploration of unfamiliar options.
3. Unit of reversibility may be single actions, data entry task, group of actions, such as entry of name address block
## Keep User in Control
1. Prevent surprises or changes in familiar behavior, tedious data-entry sequences, difficulty in obtaining necessary information, and inability to produce their desire result
2. Users desire the sense that the are in charge of the interface and interface responds to their actions.
## Reduce Short-term Memory
1. Avoid interfaces in which users must remember information from one display and then use that information on another display.
2. Cellphones should not rrequire reentry of information. website location should remain visible, and lengthy forms should be compacted to fit a single display
